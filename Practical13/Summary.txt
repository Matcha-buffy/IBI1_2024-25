Results：
The alignment results for the three sequence comparisons are as follows:
Human - Mouse Alignment:
Alignment Score: 1097
Percentage of Identical Amino Acids: 90.09%
Human - Random Alignment:
Alignment Score: -223
Percentage of Identical Amino Acids: 5.86%
Mouse - Random Alignment:
Alignment Score: -215
Percentage of Identical Amino Acids: 6.31%

Interpretation of Results：

Human - Mouse Alignment:
High Alignment Score: The score of 1097 indicates a high degree of similarity between the human and mouse SOD2 protein sequences.
High Identity Percentage: 90.09% identical amino acids further confirms their evolutionary closeness.

Human - Random Alignment:
Low Alignment Score: The score of -223 suggests that the human SOD2 protein sequence has very little similarity to the randomly generated sequence.
Low Identity Percentage: Only 5.86% of the amino acids are identical, indicating no significant evolutionary relationship.

Mouse - Random Alignment:
Low Alignment Score: The score of -215 indicates that the mouse SOD2 protein sequence also has very little similarity to the random sequence.
Low Identity Percentage: 6.31% identical amino acids further supports the lack of similarity between the mouse sequence and the random sequence.

Conclusion：
Based on the alignment scores and the percentage of identical amino acids, we can conclude the following:
The human and mouse SOD2 protein sequences are highly conserved and evolutionarily similar.
The random sequences show no significant similarity to the real sequences, demonstrating that the alignment scores and identity percentages can effectively distinguish between evolutionarily related sequences and random sequences.
