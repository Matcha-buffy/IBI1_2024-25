The practical was moderately difficult. The initial setup and understanding of the SIR model were straightforward, thanks to the clear instructions provided. However, implementing the probabilistic aspects and ensuring the model ran correctly took some effort. The use of NumPy and Matplotlib was very helpful, but debugging issues related to random number generation and array indexing required some time.
